# Vehicle Tracking Application 🚗📍

## Overview 🌟

This mobile application, developed using Flutter and Firebase, enables real-time tracking of vehicles or obtaining their position via SMS when no internet connection is available. The app operates in two modes: **User Mode** and **Vehicle Mode**. In Vehicle Mode, the app can be placed in the vehicle to be tracked, continuously sending its location to the user upon request, functioning as an IoT device that transmits GPS data to the Firebase server.
